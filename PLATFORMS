This file lists the known problems with GNUnet on various platforms.

Let us know if you know more about it then we do.  The test is quite
easy.  Run "make check" and "gnunet-transport-check" *after*
configuring GNUnet (including placing a valid gnunet.conf into
~/.gnunet and /etc/gnunet.conf).  That should yield all the
information necessary (assuming it compiles).


GNU/Linux (x86):
- perfect

FreeBSD (x86):
- perfect

OpenBSD/NetBSD:
- unknown

GNU/Linux (Ultra Sparc):
- RSA key generation may not work (libgcrypt bug) 

GNU/Linux (Alpha):
- RSA key generation may not work (libgcrypt bug)

Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8, Sparc SunFire 880):
- RSA key generation may not work (libgcrypt bug)
- IPC semaphore test fails (hmm, used to pass, not critical)

OS X (10.3.7, PowerPC):
- RSA key generation may not work (libgcrypt bug)

Cygwin (x86):
- plugins cannot be loaded (FATAL)
- difficult to compile (autotools trouble)
- gnunet-transport-check fails
