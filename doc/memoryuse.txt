List of the top known memory users in GNUnet for
the default configuration:

* Bloomfilters (size depends on DISKQUOTA, think 1-10 MB)
* AFS routing table (650 kb)
* connection send buffers (about 200 kb at 50 kbps bandwidth)
* TCP buffers (1.5k read + up to 1.5k write per connection),
  - This is a worst-case total of 350 kb for 128 connections
* querymanager ( 512 byte * (32 + query-size) ) => approx. 64k
* databases (size depends on DATABASETYPE and DISKQUOTA,
  think 0-50 MB)

Note that many larger arrays are of static size and will not be
malloc'ed.
