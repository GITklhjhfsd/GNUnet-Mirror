DETAILS:
1) make sure that anonymity-level zero content is pushed into
   the DHT by both fs (on insert/index) and by migration (for refresh)
2) cleanup of data in gap.c using core's new disconnect notification!

OUT-OF-SCOPE:
1) modify datastore to return diverse subsets of large response sets,
   except when processing for loopback! -- medium  --- 100 minutes
2) make sure core polls whenever outbound bandwidth is available
