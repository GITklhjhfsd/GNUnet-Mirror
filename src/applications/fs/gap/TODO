DETAILS:
1) make sure that anonymity-level zero content is pushed into
   the DHT by both fs (on insert/index) and by migration (for refresh)


OUT-OF-SCOPE:
1) modify datastore to return diverse subsets of large response sets,
   except when processing for loopback!
2) make sure core polls whenever outbound bandwidth is available
