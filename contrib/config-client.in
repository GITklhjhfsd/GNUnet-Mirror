	help
		Specify which additional extractor libraries should be used.
		gnunet-insert uses libextractor to extract keywords from files.
		libextractor can be dynamically extended to handle additional file
		formats. If you want to use more than the default set of extractors,
		specify additional extractor libraries here.  The format is
		[[-]LIBRARYNAME[:[-]LIBRARYNAME]*] The default is to use filenames
		and to break larger words at spaces (and underscores, etc.).  This
		should be just fine for most people. The - before a library name
		indicates that this should be executed last and makes only sense for
		the split-library.
		Default is libextractor_filename:-libextractor_split:-libextractor_lower:-libextractor_thumbnail

	depends on Meta::RARE-CLIENT
	help
		Disable symlinking.  When set to YES, GNUnet will always make
		a copy of the file when files are indexed.  The default is to
		try to use a symbolic link (if possible).
		Note that you should NEVER, NEVER simply delete the .gnunet 
		directory if this is set to 'NO', since all inserted files
		will have been moved into that directory and replaced with
		symbolic links.  So if you were to remove ~/.gnunet, you will
		loose those files unless you first run gnunet-delete to undo
		the symlinking!
		It is much more (space)-efficient to set this to NO,
		but you need to know what you're doing.  This is why the
		default is 'YES'.
