  help
		Some of the various things that GNUnet supports (such as network
		drivers, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
		of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
		testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
		known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
		currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
		uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
		avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
 		testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
		may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
		in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
		with the GNUnet internals are usually welcomed by the developers
		(before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
		<file://README> and <http://gnunet.org/faq.php3>.

		What kinds of (debug) output should be printed? You can 
		use NOTHING, FATAL, ERROR, FAILURE, WARNING, MESSAGE, INFO, DEBUG, 
		CRON or EVERYTHING (which print more and more messages in this order). 
		Default is WARNING which is usually enough to let you know if there
		is any problems.

	config LOGFILE
	string "Where to write the messages"
	default ""
	depends on Meta::ADVANCED-CLIENT
	help
		Where to write the messages? Leave the entry unspecified (as

		At which priority should the client tools run? If you don't want the

		"BELOW NORMAL" or "IDLE".
		Acceptable values are "NORMAL", "BELOW NORMAL", "ABOVE NORMAL", "HIGH",
		"IDLE" and nice(1) increments (a numeric value between -20 and 19, keep
		in mind that values smaller than 0 require root privileges).
		Default is "NORMAL".

	depends on Meta::RARE-CLIENT
	help
		Specify which additional extractor libraries should be used.
		gnunet-insert uses libextractor to extract keywords from files.
		libextractor can be dynamically extended to handle additional file
		formats. If you want to use more than the default set of extractors,
		specify additional extractor libraries here.  The format is
		[[-]LIBRARYNAME[:[-]LIBRARYNAME]*] The default is to use filenames
		and to break larger words at spaces (and underscores, etc.).  This
		should be just fine for most people. The - before a library name
		indicates that this should be executed last and makes only sense for
		the split-library.
		Default is libextractor_filename:-libextractor_split:-libextractor_lower:-libextractor_thumbnail

	bool "Disable symlinking"
	default y
	depends on Meta::RARE-CLIENT
	help
		Disable symlinking.  When set to YES, GNUnet will always make
		a copy of the file when files are indexed.  The default is to
		try to use a symbolic link (if possible).
		Note that you should NEVER, NEVER simply delete the .gnunet 
		directory if this is set to 'NO', since all inserted files
		will have been moved into that directory and replaced with
		symbolic links.  So if you were to remove ~/.gnunet, you will
		loose those files unless you first run gnunet-delete to undo
		the symlinking!
		It is much more (space)-efficient to set this to NO,
		but you need to know what you're doing.  This is why the
		default is 'YES'.
