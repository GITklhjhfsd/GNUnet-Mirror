# Specify which additional extractor libraries should be used.
# gnunet-insert uses libextractor to extract keywords from files.
# libextractor can be dynamically extended to handle additional file
# formats. If you want to use more than the default set of extractors,
# specify additional extractor libraries here.  The format is
# [[-]LIBRARYNAME[:[-]LIBRARYNAME]*] The default is to use filenames
# and to break larger words at spaces (and underscores, etc.).  This
# should be just fine for most people. The - before a library name
# indicates that this should be executed last and makes only sense for
# the split-library.

# try to use a symbolic link (if possible).
# Note that you should NEVER, NEVER simply delete the .gnunet 
# directory if this is set to 'NO', since all inserted files
# will have been moved into that directory and replaced with
# symbolic links.  So if you were to remove ~/.gnunet, you will
# loose those files unless you first run gnunet-delete to undo
