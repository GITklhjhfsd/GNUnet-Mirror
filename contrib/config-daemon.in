	depends on Meta::ADVANCED
	help
		This directory should be made available periodically --- it contains
		information how to join GNUnet that is in no way private to the
		local node.  This directory can be shared between nodes AND should
		be put on a public web-server (if possible).  You should find a list
		of known hosts under http://gnunet.org/hosts/, you can copy
		those files into this directory.
		
		If you specify a HOSTLISTURL, the directory will be automatically
		populated by gnunetd with an initial set of nodes.
		Default: HOSTS   	= $GNUNETD_HOME/data/hosts/


	config TRANSPORTS
	string "Which transport mechanisms are available?"
	default "udp tcp http nat"
	depends on Meta::ADVANCED
	help
		Which transport mechanisms are available? Use space-separated list
		of the modules, e.g.  "udp smtp tcp". The order is irrelevant, each
		protocol has a build-in cost-factor and this factor determines which
		protocols are preferred.  
		
		The available transports at this point are udp, tcp, http, smtp,
		tcp6, udp6 and the special 'nat' service.
		
		Loading the 'nat' and 'tcp' modules is required for peers behind NAT
		boxes that cannot directly be reached from the outside.  Peers that
		are NOT behind a NAT box and that want to *allow* peers that ARE
		behind a NAT box to connect must ALSO load the 'nat' module.  Note
		that the actual transfer will always be via tcp initiated by the peer
		behind the NAT box.
		
		Usually, the default is just fine for most people.
		Choices are: "udp tcp udp6 tcp6 nat http smtp"
		Default: TRANSPORTS = "udp tcp http nat"

	config PROCESS-PRIORITY
	string "Process priority"
	default "NORMAL"
	depends on Meta::ADVANCED
	help
		At which priority should the GNUnet server run? If you don't want it
		to interfere with other applications, set this to "BELOW NORMAL" 
                or "IDLE".  Acceptable values are "NORMAL" (0), "BELOW NORMAL" (10), 
                "ABOVE NORMAL" (-5), "HIGH" (-10), "IDLE" (19) and nice(1) increments 
                (a numeric value between -20 and 19, keep in mind that values smaller 
                than 0 require root privileges).  Default is "NORMAL".


	config GROUP
	string "GNUnet group"
	default ""
	depends on Meta::ADVANCED
	help
		As which group account should gnunetd run?
		Empty means current group under Unix. It has no meaning under Windows.

		This is used by the configuration wizards to remember whether to start
		the GNUnet daemon at computer startup.

menu "Network" "NETWORK"
	config INTERFACE
	string "Interface to probe for external IP"
	help
		Set if GNUnet fails to determine your IP.  GNUnet first tries to
		determine your IP by looking at the IP that matches the interface
		that is given with the option INTERFACE.
		Under Windows, specify the ID reported by "gnunet-win-tool -n".
  
	config IP
	string "Forced value of external IP or hostname"
	help
		If obtaining the external IP from an interface will not result
		in the right information, use the IP setting.  Setting IP can
                be used to specify the external IP directly or to make GNUnet
		lookup the external IP using DNS.
		
		This is typically the best option if you are behind a router/gateway
		that performs network address translation (NAT).  If the router has
		a fixed external IP, use that IP.  If the router itself obtains its
		IP dynamically (say via DHCP), use the DNS lookup in combination with
		DynDNS.  In either case make sure that the router forwards incoming
		UDP and TCP messages on the GNUnet port (default: 2086) to the 
		GNUnet host in the local network.  If this is not possible, read
		about the LIMITED option for NAT.
		
		If in doubt, try without.  Default is empty.
  
	config HELLOEXCHANGE
	bool "Participate in network topology management"
	default y
	depends on Meta::ADVANCED
	help
		If this host is connected to two networks, a private which is not
		reachable from the Internet and that contains GNUnet clients and to
		a public network, typically the Internet (and is this host is thus
		in the position of a router, typically doing NAT), then this option
		should be set to 'NO'. It prevents the node from forwarding HELLOs
		other than its own. 

                If in doubt, use YES.  Default is YES.
