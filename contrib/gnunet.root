# Options for the GNUnet server, gnunetd
#########################################

# This line gives the root-directory of the GNUnet installation. Make
# sure there is some space left in that directory. :-)  Users inserting
# or indexing files will be able to store data in this directory
# up to the (global) quota specified below.  Having a few gigabytes
# of free space is recommended.
# Default: GNUNETD_HOME     = /var/lib/GNUnet
# GNUNETD_HOME     = /var/lib/GNUnet

# How many minutes is the current IP valid?  (GNUnet will sign HELO
# messages with this expiration timeline. If you are on dialup, 60
# (for 1 hour) is suggested. If you are having a static IP address,
# you may want to set this to a large value (say 14400).  The default
# is 1440 (1 day). If your IP changes periodically, you will want to
# choose the expiration to be smaller than the frequency with which
# your IP changes.
# The largest legal value is 14400 (10 days).
# Default: HELOEXPIRES     = 1440
HELOEXPIRES     = 1440

# Loglevel, how much should be logged? You can use NOTHING, FATAL,
# ERROR, FAILURE, WARNING, MESSAGE, INFO, DEBUG, CRON or EVERYTHING
# (which log more and more messages in this order). Default is
# WARNING.
LOGLEVEL        = WARNING

# In which file should gnunetd write the logs?  If you specify
# nothing, logs are written to stderr (and note that if gnunetd runs
# in the background, stderr is closed and all logs are discarded).
# Default: LOGFILE         = $GNUNETD_HOME/logs
LOGFILE         = $GNUNETD_HOME/logs

# How long should logs be kept? If you specify a value greater
# than zero, a log is created each day with the date appended
# to its filename. These logs are deleted after $KEEPLOG days.
# To disable this function, set this setting to its default   
# value 0.
KEEPLOG         = 0

# In which file should gnunetd write the process-id of the server?  If
# you run gnunetd as root, you may want to choose
# /var/run/gnunetd.pid. It's not the default since gnunetd may not
# have write rights at that location.
# Default: PIDFILE         = $GNUNETD_HOME/gnunetd.pid
PIDFILE         = $GNUNETD_HOME/gnunetd.pid

# This directory should be made available periodically --- it contains
# information how to join GNUnet that is in no way private to the
# local node.  This directory can be shared between nodes AND should
# be put on a public web-server (if possible).  You should find a list
# of known hosts under http://gnunet.org/hosts/, you can copy
# those files into this directory.
# 
# If you specify a HOSTLISTURL, the directory will be automatically
# populated by gnunetd with an initial set of nodes.
# Default: HOSTS   	= $GNUNETD_HOME/data/hosts/
HOSTS   	= $GNUNETD_HOME/data/hosts/

# GNUnet can automatically update the hostlist from the web. While
# GNUnet internally communicates which hosts are online, it is
# typically a good idea to get a fresh hostlist whenever gnunetd
# starts from the WEB. By setting this option, you can specify from
# which server gnunetd should try to download the hostlist. The
# default should be fine for now.
#
# The general format is a list of space-separated URLs.  Each URL must
# have the format http://HOSTNAME/FILENAME
#
# If you want to setup an alternate hostlist server, you must run a
# permanent node and "cat data/hosts/* > hostlist" every few minutes
# to keep the list up-to-date.
#
# If you do not specify a HOSTLISTURL, you must copy valid hostkeys to
# data/hosts manually.
# Default: HOSTLISTURL = "http://gnunet.org/hostlist"
HOSTLISTURL = "http://gnunet.org/hostlist"

# If you have to use a proxy for outbound HTTP connections,
# specify the proxy configuration here.  Default is no proxy.
# HTTP-PROXY = localhost
# HTTP-PROXY-PORT = 1080

# Which applications should gnunetd support? Specify the name of the
# dynamic shared object (DSO) that implements the service in the
# gnunetd core here. Separate multiple modules with spaces.
#
# Whenever this option is changed, you MUST run gnunet-update.
#
# Currently, the available applications are:
# advertising: always load this one
# topology: always load this one, too!
# getoption: probably a good idea, too!
#
# stats: statistics - for gnunet-stats
# traffic: traffic analysis 
# fs: file sharing
# chat: broadcast chat (demo-application)
# tbench: benchmark tool for transport performance
# tracekit: GNUnet topology visualization toolkit
#
# The chat, tbench and tracekit protocols are potential security risks
# and have been engineered for testing GNUnet or demonstrating how
# GNUnet works. They should be used with caution.
#
# Using the fs tools for downloading may require the traffic module
# to be loaded!
#
# Default: APPLICATIONS = "advertising topology fs getoption stats traffic"
APPLICATIONS = "advertising topology fs getoption stats traffic"

# Which transport mechanisms are available? Use space-separated list
# of the modules, e.g.  "udp smtp tcp". The order is irrelevant, each
# protocol has a build-in cost-factor and this factor determines which
# protocols are preferred.  
#
# The available transports at this point are udp, tcp, http, smtp,
# tcp6, udp6 and the special 'nat' service.
#
# Loading the 'nat' and 'tcp' modules is required for peers behind NAT
# boxes that cannot directly be reached from the outside.  Peers that
# are NOT behind a NAT box and that want to *allow* peers that ARE
# behind a NAT box to connect must ALSO load the 'nat' module.  Note
# that the actual transfer will always be via tcp initiated by the peer
# behind the NAT box.
#
# Usually, the default is just fine for most people.
# Choices are: "udp tcp udp6 tcp6 nat http smtp"
# Default: TRANSPORTS = "udp tcp http nat"
TRANSPORTS = "udp tcp http nat"

# Module configuration.
# Be VERY careful here, wrong values will
# DEFINITIVELY cause GNUnet to crash.
# Read documentation at 
# FIXME: add URI here!
#
# Note that everything in this section must
# be without caps (keys and values).
# Not defining any value for any of the 
# entries is also likely to not work.
###########################################
[MODULES]

# Which database should be used?  The options
# are "sqstore_sqlite" and "sqstore_mysql".
# Default is "sqstore_sqlite".  You must run
# gnunet-update after changing this value!
#
# In order to use sqstore_mysql, you must configure
# the mysql database, which is non-trivial.
# Read the file doc/README.mysql for how to setup
# mysql.
# The default is "sqstore_sqlite".
sqstore = "sqstore_sqlite"

# Which topology should be used?  The only
# option at the moment is "topology_default".
#
# The default is "topology_default"
topology = "topology_default"


############################################
# Network configuration
############################################
[NETWORK]

# Which is the client-server port that is used between gnunetd and the
# clients (TCP only).  You may firewall this port for non-local
# machines.
# Default: PORT = 2087
PORT = 2087

# Set if GNUnet fails to determine your IP.  GNUnet first tries to
# determine your IP by looking at the IP that matches the interface
# that is given with the option INTERFACE.
# Under Windows, specify the ID reported by
#  "gnunet-win-tool -n"
# Default: INTERFACE = eth0
INTERFACE = eth0

# If this fails, GNUnet will try to do a DNS lookup on your HOSTNAME,
# which may also fail, in particular if you are on dialup.
#
# If both options are not viable for you, you can specify an IP in
# this configuration file.  This may be required if you have multiple
# interfaces (currently GNUnet can only work on one of them) or if you
# are behind a router/gateway that performs network address
# translation (NAT). In the latter case, set this IP to the *external*
# IP of the router (!) and make sure that the router forwards incoming
# UDP packets on the GNUnet port (default: 2086) to the dedicated
# GNUnet server in the local network.
#
# The given example value (127.0.0.1) will NOT work!  If you do not know
# what all this means, try without!
# Default is no IP specified.
# IP  	= 127.0.0.1

# If this host is connected to two networks, a private which is not
# reachable from the Internet and that contains GNUnet clients and to
# a public network, typically the Internet (and is this host is thus
# in the position of a router, typically doing NAT), then this option
# should be set to 'NO'. It prevents the node from forwarding HELOs
# other than its own. If you do not know what the above is about, just
# keep it set to YES (which is also the default when the option is not
# given).
# Default is yes: HELOEXCHANGE = YES
HELOEXCHANGE = YES

# With this option, you can specify which networks are trusted enough
# to connect as clients to the TCP port.  This is useful if you run
# gnunetd on one host of your network and want to allow all other
# hosts to use this node as their server. By default, this is set to
# 'loopback only'. The format is the same as for the BLACKLIST.
# Default is: TRUSTED = 127.0.0.0/8;
TRUSTED = 127.0.0.0/8;






######################################
# Options for load management 
######################################
[LOAD]
# In this section you specify how many resources GNUnet is allowed to
# use. GNUnet may exceed the limits by a small margin (network & CPU
# are hard to control directly), but should do a reasonable job to
# keep the average around these values

# For which interfaces should we do accounting?  GNUnet will evaluate
# the total traffic (not only the GNUnet related traffic) and adjust
# its bandwidth usage accordingly. You can currently only specify a
# single interface. GNUnet will also use this interface to determine
# the IP to use. Typical values are eth0, ppp0, eth1, wlan0, etc.
# 'ifconfig' will tell you what you have.  Never use 'lo', that just
# won't work.
# Under Windows, specify the ID reported by
#  "gnunet-win-tool -n".
# Default is: INTERFACES      = eth0
INTERFACES      = eth0

# Use basic bandwidth limitation? YES or NO.  The basic method (YES)
# notes only GNUnet traffic and can be used to specify simple maximum
# bandwidth usage of GNUnet.  Choose the basic method if you don't
# want other network traffic to interfere with GNUnet's operation, but
# still wish to constrain GNUnet's bandwidth usage, or if you can't
# reliably measure the maximum capabilities of your connection.  YES
# can be very useful if other applications are causing a lot of
# traffic on your LAN.  In this case, you do not want to limit the
# traffic that GNUnet can inflict on your WAN connection whenever your
# high-speed LAN gets used (e.g. by NFS).
#
# The advanced bandwidth limitation (NO) measures total traffic over
# the chosen interface (including traffic by other applications), and
# allows gnunetd to participate if the total traffic is low enough.
# Default is: BASICLIMITING = YES
BASICLIMITING = YES

# Bandwidth limits in bytes per second. These denote the maximum
# amounts GNUnet is allowed to use.
# Defaults are: 
# MAXNETUPBPSTOTAL	= 50000
# MAXNETDOWNBPSTOTAL	= 50000
MAXNETUPBPSTOTAL	= 50000
MAXNETDOWNBPSTOTAL	= 50000


# Which CPU load can be tolerated (total, GNUnet will adapt if the
# load goes up due to other processes). A value of 50 means that once
# your 1 minute-load average goes over 50% non-idle, GNUnet will start
# dropping packets until it goes under that threshold again.
# Default is MAXCPULOAD		= 50
MAXCPULOAD		= 50




###########################################
# Options for the UDP transport layer.
###########################################
[UDP]

# To which port does GNUnet bind? Default is 2086 and there is usually
# no reason to change that.
PORT		= 2086

# With this option, you can specify which networks you do NOT want to
# connect to. Usually you will want to filter loopback (127.0.0.1,
# misconfigured GNUnet hosts), virtual private networks, [add a class
# C network here], 192.168.0.0, 172.16.0.0 and 10.0.0.0 (RFC
# 1918). The format is IP/NETMASK where the IP is specified in
# dotted-decimal and the netmask either in CIDR notation (/16) or in
# dotted decimal (255.255.0.0). Several entries must be separated by a
# semicolon, spaces are not allowed.  Notice that if your host is on a
# private network like the above, you will have to configure your NAT
# to allow incoming requests and you will want to modify this option.
# The idea behind this option is not to discriminate against NAT users
# but to ensure that hosts only attempt to connect to machines that
# they have a chance to actually reach.  Of course, you could also use
# it against known adversaries that have a small IP range at their
# disposal :-) 
#
# Example (and default):
# 127.0.0.1/8;172.16.0.0/12;192.168.0.0/16;10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0;

# The MTU to use. Do not use more than your OS
# (and firewall) can support. Typically, your 
# network-MTU - 28 is optimal, for ethernet, this

# Options for SMTP transport

[SMTP]

# E-mail address to use to receive messages.  Do not specify anything

# EMAIL = foo@bar.com
# EMAIL =

# MTU for the E-mail. How large should the E-mails be that we send
# out? Default is 65536 (bytes).
MTU = 65536

# Port of the SMTP server for outbound mail.  If not specified, the
# TCP/SMTP entry from /etc/services is consulted.  Default is 25.
PORT = 25

# Hostname of the SMTP server. Default is "localhost".
SERVER = localhost

# Hostname of the sender host to use in the HELO message of the SMTP
# protocol (not to be confused with the HELO in the GNUnet p2p
# protocol). Pick a hostname that works for your SMTP server. This
# hostname has nothing to do with the hostname of the SMTP server or
# your E-mail sender address (though those names should work in most
# cases). In fact, it often does not even have to exist as a real
# machine. Example: "myhost.example.com"
SENDERHOSTNAME = myhost.example.com

# Filter-line to use in the E-mail header. This filter will be
# included in the GNUnet-generated E-mails and should be used to
# filter out GNUnet traffic from the rest of your E-mail. Make sure
# that the filter you choose is highly unlikely to occur in any other
# message.
#
# Examples:
# FILTER = "X-mailer: myGNUnetmail"
# FILTER = "Subject: foobar5252"
FILTER = "X-mailer: 590N"

# Name of the pipe via which procmail sends the filtered E-mails to

################################################
# Options for anonymous filesharing (AFS).
################################################
[FS]

# How much disk space (MB) is GNUnet allowed to use for file
# sharing?  This does not take indexed files into account, only the
# space directly used by GNUnet is accounted for.  GNUnet will gather
# content from the network if the current space-consumption is below
# the number given here (and if content migration is allowed below).
#
# IMPORTANT:
# Note that if you change the quota, you need to run gnunet-convert,
# otherwise your databases will be inconsistent and gnunetd will
# refuse to work.  Default is 1024 (1 GB)
QUOTA 	= 1024

# Should we participate in content migration?  If you say yes here,
# GNUnet will migrate content to your server, and you will not be able
# to control what data is stored on your machine.  This option has
# advantages and disadvantages.
#
# If you activate it, you can claim for *all* the non-indexed (-n to
# gnunet-insert) content that you did not know what it was even if an
# adversary takes control of your machine.
#
# If you do not activate it, it is obvious that you have knowledge of
# all the content that is hosted on your machine and thus can be
# considered liable for it.  
#
# So if you think that the legal system in your country has gone
# postal, you may want to set it to "NO" and make sure that the
# content you put on your machine does not get you into too much
# trouble if an adversary takes control of your machine.  If you think
# that you're safe if you host content that you don't know anything
# about (like an ISP) or that you don't have to fear prosecution
# no-matter-what, turn it to YES, which will also improve GNUnet's
# performance and thereby your results.
#
# Note that as long as the adversary is not really powerful (e.g. can
# not take control of your machine), GNUnet's build-in anonymity
# mechanisms should protect you from being singled out easily.
# 
# Currently, activating active migration can cause some problems when
# the database is getting full (gdbm reorganization can take very,
# very long and make GNUnet look like it hangs for that time). Thus if
# you turn it on, you may want to disable it after you hit the
# quota. A better content management system should solve this problem
# in the near future... [at the time of GNUnet 0.6.1c, the MySQL 
# database module already works well even if the db is full.]
# Default is YES.

# Where to store the FS related data (content, etc)?
DIR          = $GNUNETD_HOME/data/fs/

# Where to store indexed files (NEW!)
# Note that you MUST not copy files directly to this

# gnunet-insert run on the same machine) instead.
#
# The QUOTA option does NOT apply for this directory.
# To limit how much can be placed in this directory
# set the option INDEX-QUOTA.  Files that are merely
# linked do not count towards the quota.

# If you uncomment this option gnunetd will refuse
# content indexing requests (insertion will still be
# possible).
#
# Note that files indexed with GNUnet before Version
# 0.6.2 were not moved/linked to this directory.  But that
# should not cause any immediate problems (the files
# will continue to be downloadable).  What will be
# impossible is unindexing these files with
