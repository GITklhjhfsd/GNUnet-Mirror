%%name: GNUnet

%%short-description: Anonymous peer-to-peer file-sharing

%%full-description: GNUnet is a secure, trust-based peer-to-peer framework.
A first service implemented on top of the networking layer
allows anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing.

<p>The goal of the GNUnet project is to become the ultimate system
for free information exchange in a world hostile toward uncontrolled
communication. We value free speech above state secrets,
law-enforcement or intellectual property. GNUnet is supposed to be
an anarchistic network, where the only limitation for peers is that
they must contribute enough back to the network such that their
resource consumption does not have a significant impact on other
users.</p>

<p>GNUnet's primary design goals are to protect the privacy of its
users and to guard itself against attacks or abuse. GNUnet does
not have any mechanisms to control, track or censor users. Instead,
the GNUnet protocols aim to make it as hard as possible to find
out what is happening on the network or to disrupt operations.</p>
