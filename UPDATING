This file describes special operations that must be performed for an
upgrade between GNUnet versions.  You can obtain version of GNUnet
that you have installed by running

# gnunetd --version

If no migration procedure is listed for your version, a
data-preserving migration may not be possible.  For CVS versions,
you're on your own.

before 0.7.0pre0 to 0.7.0pre0
=============================

Migration is NOT possible, we're breaking compatibility big time.
Note that 0.7.0pre0 is a pre-release for 0.7.0, so hands-off if you do
not want to deal with a ton of bugs and lots of migration problems.
If you dare to venture here anyway, remember:

$ rm -rf .gnunet

is your friend.

Note that many things have changed in this version, so please read
the documentation very carefully, but also keep in mind that not
all of the documentation is up-to-date with the code at this point.
