0.7.0a (bugfixes)

0.7.1 (aka "stabilization"):
- Optimizations:
  * spread out scanning done in topology_*.c?
  * directories can be compacted -- add heuristic to determine
    if we should NOT padd with zeros (if we would waste too
    much space).  Needs some lookahead for size of remaining
    directory entries. (theoretically can compact some directories
    by 50% (?) -- incidentially 25% is what gzip can do on the
    current directories!)
- gnunet-chat
- DHT:
  * make dht tests work
  * XFS [ location URIs ]
- DHT optimizations [ use additional optional fields (HELOs) ]
- #747 (sharing stats for gnunet-gtk)
- insert meta-data under hash (md5? sha1? sha-512? GNUnet-URI?)
  as keyword (to allow getting meta-data from URI only)
- #678 (directory browser)
- Documentation:
  * LJ article
- support using -k multiple times in gnunet-pseudonym
- maybe: cache kblock-public/private keys 
    (1024 bit keys are much better than the 2048 bit keys,
     but this would give another performance boost, especially for
     insertion of zip files with hundreds of files/keywords!)

1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):
- implement testbed for profiling


Not under control:
- #603 (libgcrypt problem)
