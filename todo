Notes:
  RC == Release Critical 

  All issues that are targeted for the NEXT release
  should also be filed on Mantis, except for "more testcases"
  which is always an ongoing issue. 

  Features that are targeted for future releases do not have
  to be filed on Mantis (no need to bloat the database).

  Oh, and this is of course just a plan.  And plans always change.


0.7.0b [12'05] (aka "bugfixes")
- known bugs (see Mantis for updates):
  * gnunet-setup memory leaks (#878)
  * gnunet-setup category switch update bug (#892)
  * 0 bandwidth cap (#971)
- testing:
  * more "make check" targets to test: 
    + gnunet-tracekit
    + gap and economy
    + FSUI collections
    + FSUI recursive uploads and downloads (incl. persistence)
    + FSUI namespaces
    + FSUI URI tracking

0.7.1 [12'05] (aka "stabilization"):
- gnunet-setup:
  * php-ification for i18n [ Nils, not RC ]
- DHT:
  * make dht tests work
  * XFS [ location URIs ]
- support using -k multiple times in gnunet-pseudonym
- Windows installer [Nils, not RC]
  * Uninstall: Remove account

0.7.2 [1'06] (aka "performance"):
- Optimizations:
  * directories can be compacted -- add heuristic to determine
    if we should NOT padd with zeros (if we would waste too
    much space).  Needs some lookahead for size of remaining
    directory entries. (theoretically can compact some directories
    by 50% (?) -- incidentially 25% is what gzip can do on the
    current directories!)
- DHT optimizations [ use additional optional fields (HELOs) ]
- maybe: cache kblock-public/private keys 
    (1024 bit keys are much better than the 2048 bit keys,
     but this would give another performance boost, especially for
     insertion of zip files with hundreds of files/keywords!)

0.7.2 [3'06] (aka "features"):
- #747 (sharing stats for gnunet-gtk)
- insert meta-data under hash (md5? sha1? sha-512? GNUnet-URI?)
  as keyword (to allow getting meta-data from URI only)
- Documentation:
  * LJ article

0.7.3 [5'06] (aka "advanced features"):
- gnunet-chat
- Insert/Index a "shared directory" automatically [Nils]
- https://gnunet.org/drupal/?q=node/97


1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):
- implement testbed for profiling
