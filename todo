This is just the current plan, plans change.

Annotations:
  RC == Release Critical
  PRE == to be done before a pre-release

0.8.0 [6'08] (aka "advanced features"):
- full support for FSUI pause/resume of search
- power insert (#854)
- clean up VPN code
- tune GAP query planning code [RC]
- gnunet-chat (CS-only)

TESTING:
- test GAP code in general (still have one unexplained crazy crash!)

  Analysis shows that "prev->next" was set to rl in the previous
  iteration in #1.  "prev" was not zero'ed out.  table[index] points
  to a valid entry, and table[index]->next is NULL at the time of the
  crash.

 
- test RPC code (write a small demo)

Hostlist for network testing:
* http://vserver1236.vserver-on.de/hostlist-074


0.8.x (aka "growth"):
- OR service
- direct WiFi transport
- tune DHT
- testbed using remote testing topology setup
- HTTPS support (#1225)
- clean up indexing with gnunet-insert (#1107)

1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):



Small extensions (that could be done any time):
- insert meta-data under hash (md5? sha1? sha-512? GNUnet-URI?)
  as keyword (to allow getting meta-data from URI only) [RC]
- support NAT-PMP (in addition to UPnP)
- SMTP logger 




FreeServices
- onion routing
	- application service
	- unreliable connection through GNUnet core
	- initiator chooses path, other ORs suggest some (!) ORs for next hop
	  (choose path often according to suggestions, but route randomly
	   sometimes)
	- accounting
		- each predecessor ist reposible (accountable) for its predecessor
		  and has to reject connections from untrusted nodes because
		  misbehaving nodes harm own trust
	  - tell predecessor about MIN(own limits, successor's limits)
	- onion routing based transport
		- use introduction point instead of IP in HELO
		- => integrate NATed hosts
- subnet advertising (DHT, chat, GAP, ...)
	- applications register subnets, core advertises subnets
- anonymous DHT
	- create OR tunnel to ADHT node that performs DHT operation
	- check success of DHT operation through another tunnel
	- => OR and FreeService advertisements
	- Hostlist?
