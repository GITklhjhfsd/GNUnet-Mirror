0.6.7 [3?'05] (aka "features"):
- 835??  [ unknown crash ]
- 770?   [ use freedback (LOG) in gnunet-gtk via show-messages ]
- 704?   [ auto-reindex downloaded files ]
- 678?   [ directory browser ]
- 593??? [ gnunet-setup ]

0.7.0pre0 [2'05] (aka "pre-preview"):
- Need testing:
  * ECRS-directories (build, iterate)
  * gnunet-directory
  * gnunet-pseudonym

0.7.0pre1 [4'05] (aka "preview"):
- util:
  * switch hash to SHA-512
  * switch cipher to AES-256
- testing:
  * sqlite-tests: test update function, concurrency with iterators
- topology:
  * do aggressive bootstrap on first start (Christian) [ easy ]
- gnunet-search: 
  * dump directory with search results [ easy ]
- ecrs-search:
  * anonymity policy is ignored [ easy ]
- gap:
  * economy for local queries (see applications/gap/TODO) [ tricky ]
- FSUI:
  * download: various details wrt generated events
  * namespace updates
  * collections

0.7.0 [5'05] (aka "compatibility? what's that?"):
- Missing Features:
  * resolve "FIXME 0.7"
  * configure.ac: flags for mysql, gmp, libgcrypt should ONLY be passed when
    linking the respective modules / libraries (gnunet_util, sqstore_mysql) [ tricky ]
  * fsui core (persistence) [ difficult ]
- Features removed but to be revived:
  * fsui download: limit parallelism (currently unlimited, old gnunet-download allowed
    user to specify maximum amount of parallelism) [ tricky ]
- Need testing:
  * gnunet-dht-join and gnunet-dht-query 
  * gnunet-tracekit, -tbench, -chat 
- Documentation changes (to be documented):
  * ECRS block format changes (dramatic!)
  * gnunet-directory (no more categories) and gnunet-pseudonym (no passwords)

0.7.x (aka "stabilization"):
- add gnunet-gtk (or some other GUI)
- gnunet-chat: have a real implementation.
- DHT optimizations:
  * optional fields (HELOs)
- #727
- XFS 
- #675
- #747 (sharing stats for gnunet-gtk)

1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):
- #593 (gnunet-setup)
- #678 (directory browser)
- #704 (reindex downloaded files)
- implement testbed for profiling 


Not under control:
- #603 (libgcrypt problem)





gnunet-gtk wishlist (unallocated tasks unless mentioned 
otherwise, feel free to implement):

- while (!) downloading directory, display already received results 
  for download (now supported by libecrs!)
- add option to list all indexed files and perhaps delete from them
- for potentially long clists, add option to specify a string 
  pattern that must be matched for the lines to be displayed 
  (to further prune search results, for example)
- implement search bookmarking (e.g. user could add/edit/delete 
  favourite namespace/key etc combinations)
- in Assemble Directory's Files Available/Selected
    Add sortability 
    Add multiselection  
    Print filenames as well
- add right button popup menu operations for
    Select by pattern
  in the search result list.
- a completely new interactive namespace/directory building
  module that would allow importing files/directories from
  disk and edit various parameters, file descriptions and 
  the dir tree structure before the insertion.
- give user opportunity to change namespace rating after
  namespace download succeeded
