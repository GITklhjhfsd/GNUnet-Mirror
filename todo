notes:
  RC == Release Critical 

  All issues that are targeted for the NEXT release
  should also be filed on Mantis, except for "more testcases"
  which is always an ongoing issue. 

  Features that are targeted for future releases do not have
  to be filed on Mantis (no need to bloat the database).

  Oh, and this is of course just a plan.  And plans always change.


0.7.1a [1'07]:
- Windows installer [Nils]
  * uninstall: Remove account
  * libcurl, guile
- bugfixes:
  Heikki reports:
  Ran the current svn over 10 times under gdb (serializetest2)
  One time it exited with status=1 and said
  "Download suspended but search reference not set correctly."
  DexterF reports:

  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status 


0.7.2 [3'07]:
- new features:
  * XFS / support for location URIs [CG] 
    + dht/tools: update clients [RC]
    + dht/gap integration [RC]
    + ecrs/location URIs [RC]
    + fsui/location URI support [RC]
    + dstore bloomfilter (optimization)
  * HTTP transport (libcurl, libmicrohttpd)
  * SMTP transport (libesmtp)
  * SMTP logger
- minor improvements:
  * Scheme (scm) specification of entire configuration;
    check options used in modules:
    + DHT options
    + kvstore
  * directories can be compacted -- add heuristic to determine
    if we should NOT padd with zeros (if we would waste too
    much space).  Needs some lookahead for size of remaining
    directory entries. (theoretically can compact some directories
    by 50% (?) -- incidentially 25% is what gzip can do on the
    current directories!) [ CG ]
- testcases (fix, add):
  * dht/tools
  * ecrs_core
  * gap (incl. economy)
  * advertising


0.7.3 [6'07] (aka "features"):
- #747 (sharing stats for gnunet-gtk)
- insert meta-data under hash (md5? sha1? sha-512? GNUnet-URI?)
  as keyword (to allow getting meta-data from URI only)
- Chat support basics [RC]
- Documentation:
  * LJ article
- Testcases:
  * tracekit
  * RPC

0.7.4 [12'07] (aka "advanced features"):
- gnunet-chat [ RC ]
- Insert/Index a "shared directory" automatically [Nils]
- https://gnunet.org/drupal/?q=node/97


1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):
- implement testbed for profiling


FreeServices
	- onion routing
		- application service
		- unreliable connection through GNUnet core
		- initiator chooses path, other ORs suggest some (!) ORs for next hop
		  (choose path often according to suggestions, but route randomly
		   sometimes)
		- accounting
			- each predecessor ist reposible (accountable) for its predecessor
			  and has to reject connections from untrusted nodes because
			  misbehaving nodes harm own trust
		  - tell predecessor about MIN(own limits, successor's limits)
		- onion routing based transport
			- use introduction point instead of IP in HELO
			- => integrate NATed hosts
	- subnet advertising (DHT, chat, GAP, ...)
		- applications register subnets, core advertises subnets
	- anonymous DHT
		- create OR tunnel to ADHT node that performs DHT operation
		- check success of DHT operation through another tunnel
		- => OR and FreeService advertisements
		- Hostlist?
