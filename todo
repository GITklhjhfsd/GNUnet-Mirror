0.6.6 [1'05] (aka "intermezzo"):
- Win32 port
- gnunet-insert bugs (see Mantis)

0.7.0pre0 [4'05] (aka "preview"):
- AFS:
  a) complete libfsui:
     - namespace creation
     - namespace updates
     - collections
  b) complete gnunet-afs-tools:
     - insert - DONE (very rough cut)
     - download - COMPILES
- Missing Features:
  * fs/module/fs+migration: anonymity level and expiration time considerations (Christian)
  * gap: economy for local queries, forwardQuery dead?, anonymityLevel
  * ecrs-download: some stats, some details in the heuristics
  * gnunet-search: dump directory with search results,
                   get filename from meta-data for -o option,
                   handle anonymity-level setting
  * fsui upload: ETA, tracking URIs
  * fsui core (persistence, shutdown, multiple FSUIs)
  * gnunet-insert: namespace insertion, check options, keyword to utf8 conversion
- Need testing:
  * ECRS-directories (build, iterate)
  * FS/ECRS upload/download
  * gnunet-directory
  * gnunet-pseudonym
  * gnunet-search

0.7.0 [6'05] (aka "compatibility? what's that?"):
- Missing Features:
  * topology: do eager bootstrap on first start (Christian)
  * ecrs-unindex: code cleanup
  * fix dht routing service
     - make dht respect new dht API (long way to go)
     - fs-dht integration
  * sqlite sqstore implementation does not compile yet (Nils)
  * configure.ac: flags for mysql, gmp, libgcrypt should ONLY be passed when
    linking the respective modules / libraries (gnunet_util, sqstore_mysql)
- Features removed but to be revived:
  * fsui download: limit parallelism (currently unlimited, old gnunet-download allowed
    user to specify maximum amount of parallelism)
- Need testing:
  * gnunet-dht-join and gnunet-dht-query 
  * gnunet-tracekit, -tbench, -chat 
- Documentation changes (to be documented):
  * ECRS block format changes (dramatic!)
  * gnunet-directory (no more categories) and gnunet-pseudonym (no passwords)

0.7.x (aka "stabilization"):
- gnunet-chat: have a real implementation.
- DHT optimizations:
  * optional fields (HELOs)
- #727
- XFS 
- #675
- #747 (sharing stats for gnunet-gtk)

1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):
- Win32 port
- #593 (gnunet-setup)
- #678 (directory browser)
- #704 (reindex downloaded files)
- implement testbed for profiling 


Not under control:
- #603 (libgcrypt problem)





gnunet-gtk wishlist (unallocated tasks unless mentioned 
otherwise, feel free to implement):

- while (!) downloading directory, display already received results 
  for download (now supported by libecrs!)
- add option to list all indexed files and perhaps delete from them
- for potentially long clists, add option to specify a string 
  pattern that must be matched for the lines to be displayed 
  (to further prune search results, for example)
- implement search bookmarking (e.g. user could add/edit/delete 
  favourite namespace/key etc combinations)
- in Assemble Directory's Files Available/Selected
    Add sortability 
    Add multiselection  
    Print filenames as well
- add right button popup menu operations for
    Select by pattern
  in the search result list.
- a completely new interactive namespace/directory building
  module that would allow importing files/directories from
  disk and edit various parameters, file descriptions and 
  the dir tree structure before the insertion.
- give user opportunity to change namespace rating after
  namespace download succeeded
