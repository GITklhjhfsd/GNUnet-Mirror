This is just the current plan, plans change.

Annotations:
  RC == Release Critical

0.7.3 [8'07] (aka "features"):
- chat support basics [RC]
- old/new features:
  * HTTP transport (libcurl, libmicrohttpd) [#765]
  * SMTP transport (libesmtp)
- Documentation:
  * LJ article
- Testcases:
  * more XFS/DHT
  * tracekit
  * RPC
  * chat

0.8.0 [12'07] (aka "advanced features"):
- gnunet-chat [ RC ]
- Insert/Index a "shared directory" automatically [Nils]
  See also: https://gnunet.org/drupal/?q=node/97 [RC]
  Furthermore: blake suggested indexing a document only after
  a keyword of the document has been requested (so we would 
  add a special block to the datastore and then trigger
  gnunet-insert only if the file is actually needed!)
- guard friendly connection count (#1018) [RC]
- power insert [#854]

1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):
- implement testbed for profiling


Small extensions (that could be done any time):
- insert meta-data under hash (md5? sha1? sha-512? GNUnet-URI?)
  as keyword (to allow getting meta-data from URI only) [RC]
- support NAT-PMP (in addition to UPnP)
- SMTP logger 
- mysql implementation of dstore




FreeServices
- onion routing
	- application service
	- unreliable connection through GNUnet core
	- initiator chooses path, other ORs suggest some (!) ORs for next hop
	  (choose path often according to suggestions, but route randomly
	   sometimes)
	- accounting
		- each predecessor ist reposible (accountable) for its predecessor
		  and has to reject connections from untrusted nodes because
		  misbehaving nodes harm own trust
	  - tell predecessor about MIN(own limits, successor's limits)
	- onion routing based transport
		- use introduction point instead of IP in HELO
		- => integrate NATed hosts
- subnet advertising (DHT, chat, GAP, ...)
	- applications register subnets, core advertises subnets
- anonymous DHT
	- create OR tunnel to ADHT node that performs DHT operation
	- check success of DHT operation through another tunnel
	- => OR and FreeService advertisements
	- Hostlist?
