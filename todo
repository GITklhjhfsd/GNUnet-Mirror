0.7.0pre1 [4'05] (aka "preview"):
TESTING / TESTCASES:
- FSLIB:
  * Nils's symlink "improvements" broke the code, fslibtest fails
    (first bug, a deadlock due to synchronous del has been fixed)
- multi-peer: (see sessiontest.c and tbenchtest.c for templates)
  * gap
  * dht / gnunet-dht-join and gnunet-dht-query
- FSUI
- gnunet-pseudonym

0.7.0 [5'05] (aka "compatibility? what's that?"):
- Missing Features:
  * resolve "FIXME 0.7"
  * fsui core (persistence) [ difficult ]
  * read 'friends' list for topology_f2f
  * spread out scanning done in topology_*.c?
- Features removed but to be revived:
  * fsui download: limit parallelism (currently unlimited, old gnunet-download allowed
    user to specify maximum amount of parallelism) [ tricky ]
  * gnunet-gtk
- Need testing:
  * gnunet-tracekit
- Documentation changes (to be documented):
  * ECRS block format changes (dramatic!)
  * gnunet-directory (no more categories) and gnunet-pseudonym (no passwords)
- #593 (gnunet-setup)
- #770? [ use freedback (LOG) in gnunet-gtk via show-messages ]

0.7.x (aka "stabilization"):
- gnunet-chat
- XFS [ location URIs ]
- DHT optimizations [ use additional optional fields (HELOs) ]
- #747 (sharing stats for gnunet-gtk)
- insert meta-data under hash (md5? sha1? sha-512? GNUnet-URI?)
  as keyword (to allow getting meta-data from URI only)
- #678 (directory browser)

1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):
- implement testbed for profiling


Not under control:
- #603 (libgcrypt problem)





gnunet-gtk wishlist (unallocated tasks unless mentioned
otherwise, feel free to implement):

- while (!) downloading directory, display already received results
  for download (now supported by libecrs!)
- add option to list all indexed files and perhaps delete from them
  (ECRS now supports listing of indexed files!)
- for potentially long clists, add option to specify a string
  pattern that must be matched for the lines to be displayed
  (to further prune search results, for example)
- implement search bookmarking (e.g. user could add/edit/delete
  favourite namespace/key etc combinations)
- in Assemble Directory's Files Available/Selected
    Add sortability
    Add multiselection
    Print filenames as well
- add right button popup menu operations for
    Select by pattern
  in the search result list.
- a completely new interactive namespace/directory building
  module that would allow importing files/directories from
  disk and edit various parameters, file descriptions and
  the dir tree structure before the insertion.
- give user opportunity to change namespace rating after
  namespace download succeeded
