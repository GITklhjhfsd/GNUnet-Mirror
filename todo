This is just the current plan, plans change.

Annotations:
  RC == Release Critical

0.7.4 [4'08] (aka "fix search"):
- tune GAP query planning code [RC]

TESTING:
- test new hostlist application
- test GAP migration code (seems to be using far too much CPU!)
- test GAP code in general (still have one unexplained crazy crash!)

Hostlist for network testing:
* http://vserver1236.vserver-on.de/hostlist-074


0.8.0 [6'08] (aka "advanced features"):
- gnunet-chat [ RC ]
- power insert [#854]
- RPC API and testcase


1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):

Small extensions (that could be done any time):
- insert meta-data under hash (md5? sha1? sha-512? GNUnet-URI?)
  as keyword (to allow getting meta-data from URI only) [RC]
- support NAT-PMP (in addition to UPnP)
- SMTP logger 




FreeServices
- onion routing
	- application service
	- unreliable connection through GNUnet core
	- initiator chooses path, other ORs suggest some (!) ORs for next hop
	  (choose path often according to suggestions, but route randomly
	   sometimes)
	- accounting
		- each predecessor ist reposible (accountable) for its predecessor
		  and has to reject connections from untrusted nodes because
		  misbehaving nodes harm own trust
	  - tell predecessor about MIN(own limits, successor's limits)
	- onion routing based transport
		- use introduction point instead of IP in HELO
		- => integrate NATed hosts
- subnet advertising (DHT, chat, GAP, ...)
	- applications register subnets, core advertises subnets
- anonymous DHT
	- create OR tunnel to ADHT node that performs DHT operation
	- check success of DHT operation through another tunnel
	- => OR and FreeService advertisements
	- Hostlist?
