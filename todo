Notes:
  RC == Release Critical 

  All issues that are targetd for the NEXT release
  should also be filed on Mantis, except for "more testcases"
  which is always an ongoing issue. 

  Features that are targeted for future releases do not have
  to be filed on Mantis (no need to bloat the database).

  Oh, and this is of course just a plan.  And plans always change.


0.7.0 [30.8.2005?] (aka "compatibility? what's that?"):
- Missing Features:
  * gnunet-gtk namespace stuff (#872, #884)  [ Christian, RC! ]
  * gnunet-setup: php-ification for i18n [ Nils ]
  * permissions on indexed files? [Nils]
    If gnunetd has insufficient file permissions on files
    to be indexed, copy it to shared dir and index it there.
    [ NILS: if still there, please elaborate on Mantis!)
  * Windows installer [Nils]
    * Uninstall
      * Remove account
    [ NILS: if still there, please elaborate on Mantis!)
  * #893 (mysql prepared statement for update) 
- known bugs:
  * gnunet-gtk namespace upload (#885) [ Christian, RC ]
  * gnunet-setup memory leaks (#878)
  * gnunet-gtk "clear" button does not always work
- investigate: 
  * #890 (valgrind sqlite), #892 (gconfig focus changes)
- testing:
  * on Windows 98 [Nils]
  * more "make check" targets to test:  [ not RC ]
    + gnunet-tracekit
    + gap and economy
    + FSUI collections
    + FSUI recursive uploads and downloads (incl. persistence)
    + FSUI namespaces
    + FSUI URI tracking

0.7.0a [9'05] (bugfixes)

0.7.1 [10'05] (aka "stabilization"):
- DHT:
  * make dht tests work
  * XFS [ location URIs ]
- support using -k multiple times in gnunet-pseudonym

0.7.2 [12'05] (aka "performance"):
- Optimizations:
  * directories can be compacted -- add heuristic to determine
    if we should NOT padd with zeros (if we would waste too
    much space).  Needs some lookahead for size of remaining
    directory entries. (theoretically can compact some directories
    by 50% (?) -- incidentially 25% is what gzip can do on the
    current directories!)
- DHT optimizations [ use additional optional fields (HELOs) ]
- maybe: cache kblock-public/private keys 
    (1024 bit keys are much better than the 2048 bit keys,
     but this would give another performance boost, especially for
     insertion of zip files with hundreds of files/keywords!)

0.7.2 [1'06] (aka "features"):
- #747 (sharing stats for gnunet-gtk)
- insert meta-data under hash (md5? sha1? sha-512? GNUnet-URI?)
  as keyword (to allow getting meta-data from URI only)
- Documentation:
  * LJ article

0.7.3 [5'06] (aka "advanced features"):
- gnunet-chat
- Insert/Index a "shared directory" automatically [Nils]
- https://gnunet.org/drupal/?q=node/97


1.0.0 (aka "userfriendly"):
- implement testbed for profiling
