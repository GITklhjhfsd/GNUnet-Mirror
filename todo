  * resolve "FIXME 0.7": only sqlite magic factor missing!
  * #593 (gnunet-setup): php-ification for i18n [ Nils ]

     without caching it'll be unbearable, espeically for
     insertion of zip files with hundreds of files/keywords!)

  * gnunet-tracekit
  * gap and economy
  * FSUI:
    + collections
    + recursive uploads and downloads (incl. persistence)
